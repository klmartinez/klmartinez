abstract: The hypermobile Ehlersâ€“Danlos syndrome (hEDS) GENE study is a multicenter, cohort study with the goal to identify genes associated with hypermobile EDS. Of the 148 people enrolled in the hEDS GENE study, 98 meet the 2017 hEDS criteria, 27 have a hypermobility spectrum disorder (HSD) and 23 are asymptomatic family members. More than 80% of participants are female with an average age of 41 years. Each participant has completed seven questionnaires to quantify disease-related symptomatology. People with hypermobility experience a variety of physical and somatic symptoms, especially in the areas of fatigue, kinesiophobia, gastrointestinal, and autonomic function. These cause a significant decrease in health-related quality of life. The frequency and severity of most symptoms were indistinguishable between participants with hEDS and HSD; however, there were significant differences in autonomic symptoms. Less than 20% of participants had autoantibodies known to be associated with dysautonomia. Subtle symptomatic differences in people meeting the 2017 diagnostic criteria suggest focusing further etiologic studies on autonomic pathways.
