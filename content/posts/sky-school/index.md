### [University of Arizona Sky School](https://skyschool.arizona.edu/)

The University of Arizona Sky School provides place-based and inquiry-based science education programs to Arizona K-12 students. Using the unique sky island environment in the Catalina Mountains, they strive to merge a wide variety of science and engineering disciplines to foster a deeper understanding of our earth, while building an appreciation for our sense of place.

I am proud to have been able to serve as an Instructor for Sky School during my graduate experience where I taught inquiry‑based science education to Arizona K‑12 students using the unique sky island environment in the Catalina Mountains. We focused on core University of Arizona science areas such as sky island ecology, geology, and astronomy and met Arizona State and Next Generation Science standards.
